    <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hi there! My name is Bailey Griggs, and I am from Chicago, Illinois. Ever since I was a kid, I always had a camera in my hand capturing the outdoors, my friends, and special moments that my family shared. In high school, I started learning composition and photography on film cameras, where I mastered developing film, as well as printing my own film photographs. I created my own freelance photography business and had clients hire me for weddings, engagement announcements, business photographs, senior portraits, family photos, and so on! My senior year of high school, I was invited to be a teacher's assistnant in the film lab where I was lucky enough to teach underclassmen the art I fell in love with.</p>

      <p>I then went on to major in Communication and Media, while minoring in photography, at DePaul University in Chicago, Illinois. The art classes I took to fulfil my minor included digital photograhy, experiemntal film, and a class dedicated to the study and creation of photobooks. At the same time, I started learning more about the environment and the ways that communication and media are playing a crucial role in climate change communication and mitigation.</p>
      <p>Those discoveries lead me to my undertaking of a Master's degree in Environment, Culture, and Media from The University of Miami in Florida. Part of my studies analysized enviromental media such as film, televison, commercial advertising, and organization communciation.</p>
